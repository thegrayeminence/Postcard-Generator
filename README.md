# Oliver Gray, Phase 2 Project: Postcard Genie

## 'Postcard Generator' (—or Postcard Genie, name tbd—) is a platform designed to allow users to create custom postcards on the fly! 

## The initial concept was to allow users to generate the primary artwork and styling options for the postcards via generative AI (driven by data gathered from them via text prompts and checkboxes/dropdowns), along with basic text content for the cards (like 'subject:'/'to:'/'from:'/'message:'/'address:'/etc.), but the focus eventually shifted to a more direct and traditional system for generating and styling the postcards due the the difficulty/cost involved in communicating with generative AI API. Currently, users can input 'prompts' that select images for their cards from an API containing a database of images; users can also select other options like including a postage stamp/border and selecting a variety of 'themes' that change the texture and font-style of the cards. 

## Other features include a gallery where the cards are automatically uploaded (and can be downloaded locally), along with basic utilities like a dark/light mode toggle, an 'About' drawer, etc.
